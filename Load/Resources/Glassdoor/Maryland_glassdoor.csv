Experience in conducting original research – either independently or as a member of a research group or lab – including research design, novel data collections, data analysis, and preparation of papers, posters, or other presentations, is preferred.
Familiarity with areas of data science such as multi-level modeling, machine learning (e.g. methods for regularization, classification, and clustering), natural language processing (text pre-processing, text classification, named entity recognition, etc.), computer vision (e.g. image classification, image object detection), or deep learning libraries is preferred.
Familiarity with Bayesian estimation and software for Bayesian inference (e.g. JAGS, Stan) is preferred.
Experience with version control workflows and tools (e.g. Git), databases (e.g. SQL), big data technologies (Hadoop, Spark, Hive, etc.), and cloud computing environments (e.g. AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, etc.) is preferred
