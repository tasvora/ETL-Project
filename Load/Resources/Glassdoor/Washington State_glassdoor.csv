Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center|Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here. Biostatistics, Bioinformatics and Epidemiology (BBE) at Fred Hutch is seeking an experienced Data Scientist to work on multiple projects investigating the immunological correlates of vaccine protection for novel tuberculosis and HIV vaccine candidates.

Fred Hutch|"Overview


 Cures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch's pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation's first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women's Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.

The Innovation Laboratory (iLab) at Fred Hutch is seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist. The iLab is a new collaborative initiative of the Immunotherapy and Translational Data Science Integrated Research Centers (IIRC and TDS_IRC) with a mission to advance the introduction and development of new immuno-oncology research technologies. The iLab will spur in-house development and early adoption of novel techniques, including advanced single cell RNA spatial sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, and other DNA/RNA-based technologies. The data scientist will work closely with lab personnel and immunotherapy researchers to develop data analysis methods for new technologies.

Over the past three years, Fred Hutch has launched three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs) to increase collaborative research across the Center and stimulate transformative cancer discovery. The IIRC, led by Dr. Stanley Riddell, and the TDS_IRC, led by Dr. Raphael Gottardo, have joined together and created the iLab to speed adoption of novel technologies, particularly those that generate large datasets of high utility to immunotherapy. The successful candidate will be embedded in the iLab, but will also have close ties to the Gottardo Lab and the TDS_IRC. The iLab will initially be housed in the Bielas Lab. Working closely with Drs. Bielas and Gottardo, the successful candidate will function with a high degree of independence as they manage daily activities. We see the integration of computational work within the iLab as an integral part of its success, providing computational innovation.

As a Fred Hutch strategic initiative, we value inclusion and a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives to inform our work. We believe in supporting each other through mentorship and providing resources for professional development. Given these values, we strive to make our recruitment and promotion processes fair and transparent. Therefore, we strongly encourage all individuals with an interest in the position to apply.
