Recursion Pharmaceuticals|"At Recursion, we combine experimental biology, automation and artificial intelligence to quickly and efficiently identify treatments for human diseases. The Principal Data Scientist (Computational Chemistry) will identify and use computational chemistry methods, integrating them with machine learning and data science approaches to augment our AI platform, accelerate our current drug discovery programs, and lead towards the discovery of high value medicines.

THE PROBLEMS YOU'LL SOLVE

This is an individual contributor position reporting to the Director, Data Science, in which you'll help lead the expansion of Recursion's capabilities downstream of our high-throughput image-based phenotypic discovery platform. Specifically, you will collaborate with teams spanning data science, chemistry, and biology to apply ligand-based drug design techniques in the context of therapeutic project teams, and help guide methods development efforts in this area to complement a phenotypic-discovery-oriented process.

In this role you will:

Build. You will advance chemistry related R&D processes across Recursion's small molecule discovery programs by identifying and building computational tools to accelerate and automate them. You will apply the methods in hit to lead and lead optimization programs. In collaboration with chemistry, you will actively identify opportunities to contribute to Recursion's chemical space strategy, e.g. in evolving the screening library.
Guide, Create, and Question. Just because something has been done one way for decades doesn't mean it's optimal. You will bring new methods to bear while staying thoughtful about the value that exists from many tried and true approaches, and guide your peers in the implementation of a creative vision for computational chemistry in drug discovery.
Code. You are both a chemist and technologist at heart and won't be happy unless you are also writing code to be used throughout the organization.

THE EXPERIENCE YOU'LL NEED

Advanced degree in Computational Chemistry, Physical Organic Chemistry, Computer Science, Machine Learning, or relevant fields.
Experience in shaping and executing programs in computational medicinal chemistry and pharmacology as part of multidisciplinary teams.
Demonstrated contributions that changed the course of both active therapeutic candidate projects and longer-term research and development programs.
3+ years experience in developing ligand-based drug design methods, including pharmacophore modeling, QSAR, 3D-QSAR, and conformational analysis.
Experience in developing novel predictive models for DMPK/Tox in the context of active candidate programs is desirable.
Experience developing new methods and products in computational chemistry for virtual library assembly and screening
Experience in machine learning applied to chemistry, including both classical (e.g., matched-pairs and substructure analysis) and recent (e.g., representation learning and graph convolutional) methods.
Expertise programming in thePython data stack, including ML packages such as Scikit-Learn,PyTorch, and Tensorflow/Keras, in a Linux environment.

Knowledge of a statistical computing language, such as R.

Skill with data access and reporting tools: SQL and/or Cognos (or other business intelligence tools such as Tableau).

Strong organizational skills. Ability to manage multiple priorities and meet project deadlines.

Ability to focus the level of research commensurate with the stated need for the project.

Ability to work with clients within the institution to refine analytical and research questions and, as necessary, serve as a data consultant.

Ability to write clear, concise papers/summaries of statistical findings, analytics and data for a non-technical audience that emphasize visualization of results.

Ability to present statistical findings clearly and convincingly to internal audiences, and, where necessary, to explain statistical concepts to non-statisticians.

Effective communication skills and comfort working with different teams within the organization.

Must be a creative and collaborative team player with the ability to interact with a diverse team and a proven history of accepting and giving constructive feedback.

Ability to communicate effectively with a broad range of diverse people, ability, culture, ethnic background, to maintain good working relationships across the College.
