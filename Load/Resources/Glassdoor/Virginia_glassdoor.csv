DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES

NATO established Headquarters Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (HQ SACT) in Norfolk, VA, in 2003 to lead transformation efforts and improve military capabilities to meet 21st century security and defense requirements. This work encompasses the need to enhance the Alliance’s ability to apply a comprehensive approach to the conduct of future operations and engagement with partners, NATO’s interaction with non-NATO entities that include states, non-state actors and international and non-governmental organizations.

Pursuant to the decision by the North Atlantic Council to implement the NATO Command Structure Adaptation, ACT has developed a Strategic Alternatives Branch (SALT). The Branch provides the Commander with alternative ideas derived through the extensive use of data science and analytics that exist outside NATO’s conventional processes in the service of Warfare Development.

The scope of this work is to drive improvements to the quality of NATO’s situational awareness, risk assessment, strategy, and decision making over the mid- to long-term horizon through the application of data science and analytics to improve organizational performance throughout the Alliance.
Job responsibilities include:

Provision of technical expertise regarding the application of data science and analytics to strategic alternatives. Leverages various statistical techniques to identify patterns within large data sets to make predictions and enterprise-oriented suggestions. Utilizes predictive modeling to increase and optimize the effects of Warfare Development.
Development of strategies to identify patterns within large data sets, make predictions based on data science, and provide corresponding recommendations to senior leadership. Simplifies and communicates key findings and insights to senior leadership and draws implications for work organization-wide

DESCRIPTION OF DUTIES

NATO established Headquarters Supreme Allied Commander Transformation (HQ SACT) in Norfolk, VA, in 2003 to lead transformation efforts and improve military capabilities to meet 21st century security and defense requirements. This work encompasses the need to enhance the Alliance’s ability to apply a comprehensive approach to the conduct of future operations and engagement with partners, NATO’s interaction with non-NATO entities that include states, non-state actors and international and non-governmental organizations.

Pursuant to the decision by the North Atlantic Council to implement the NATO Command Structure Adaptation, ACT has developed a Strategic Alternatives Branch (SALT). The Branch provides the Commander with alternative ideas derived through the extensive use of data science and analytics that exist outside NATO’s conventional processes in the service of Warfare Development.
