Airspace Link, Inc. is hiring a Geospatial Data Scientist to help build the tools used to manage local airspace, commercial drone logistics, and beyond visual line of sight operations. Yes, the jetsonian-future is finally upon us and we need help creating the future of unmanned aerial vehicles! 
This is a role for someone with experience manipulating large and diverse datasets with the know-how to coax data diamonds out of the rough. This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO. 
Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. Wed love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career. 
About The Job 
The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.
If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.
You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.
Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets. We'll ask you to participate in the preparation and staging of the data across a range of computing solutions.
Automation will play an important role in the success of this position as well. Can you scale the probability of an autonomous aerial vehicle striking a human or vehicle in any geography in the nation?
About You 
Everyone at Airspace Link is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame. We're committed generalists, eager learners, consciences workers and curators of what's essential. 
We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that were here for the same purpose: do go good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.
You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.
You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.
Some of the bullet points:Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analyticsStrong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skillsAbility to develop robust data queries using SQLGraduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific fieldSome experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc)Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R


About Our Pay & Benefits 
Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope youre the latter. 
We aim to be competitive but wont be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best. 
We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. Were all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, fitness, wellness, and healthy living. 
How To Apply 
Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us the future. 
We value good communication and solid writing is part of that. We expect to see a well-constructed cover letter along with your professional history. Forget the generic resume (and it's so blatantly obvious). There's no prize for being first. Copy and paste doesn't make it very far and we strongly encourage you to take this part of the application process seriously.

Airspace Link, Inc.|"Hello! Airspace Link, Inc. is hiring a Geospatial Data Scientist to help build the tools used to manage local airspace, commercial drone logistics, and beyond visual line of sight operations. Yes, the jetsonian-future is finally upon us and we need help creating the future of unmanned aerial vehicles! 
This is a role for someone with experience manipulating large and diverse datasets with the know-how to coax data diamonds out of the rough. This is the first offering of this type within our organization and will report to the CTO. 
Airspace Link is headquartered out of Detroit, MI with a remote office in northern Utah. Wed love for candidates to be centered in these geographic regions but understand that the best person for the job may live somewhere else. In short, the right remote candidates are considered, however Detroit based candidates will be given preference. International candidates are not considered at this time.
We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new hire is an opportunity for us to bring in a different perspective, and we are eager to further diversify our company. Airspace Link is committed to building an inclusive, supportive place for you to do the best and most rewarding work of your career. 
About The Job 
The Geospatial Data Scientist will be part of an agile team responsible for deriving risk associated with the potential of drone operational failures. The more these vehicles go up, the more likely they'll come down, and our mission is to build the best probability models in the industry. Risk can be quantified by a wide range of external influencers, including both predictable and unpredictable (e.g. weather) aerial and ground-based factors.
If you're digging the autonomous future, this role is for you. You will be directly influencing the ability for autonomous drone operations to be a successful national integration, instead of a tragic news headline.
You'll be working with a diverse set of authoritative geospatial data provided through our clients, in conjunction with public and other 3rd-party datasets to help build our data product and solution offerings.
Your output will be shared via application programming interfaces (API), web and mobile applications, single-use digital maps and reports, or even simple internal spreadsheets. We'll ask you to participate in the preparation and staging of the data across a range of computing solutions.
Automation will play an important role in the success of this position as well. Can you scale the probability of an autonomous aerial vehicle striking a human or vehicle in any geography in the nation?
About You 
Everyone at Airspace Link is here to do the best work of their career, so we work on systemic problems and try to avoid individual blame. We're committed generalists, eager learners, consciences workers and curators of what's essential. 
We value people who can take a stand yet commit even when they disagree. We subject ideas to rigorous debate, but we remember that were here for the same purpose: do go good work together. Charging the trust battery is part of the work.
You'll be expected to come to the table with commercial and academic experience in data science, data mining, statistics (including probability theory), graph algorithms, machine learning, and spatial optimization. That's to say, there will be alot of hard problems to solve and you'll need a strong and diverse toolbox to get the work done. As an expert, you'll be expected to recommend and execute on overall modeling strategies with confidence and a well conceived notion on how to succeed.
You are thoughtful in the evaluation of your models, improving them over time as they interact with real users.
Some of the bullet points:Proficiency with Esri software suite, including raster analyticsStrong analytic, cartographic, and presentation skillsAbility to develop robust data queries using SQLGraduate level competency in mathematics, statistics, computer science, or equivalent scientific fieldSome experience with cloud providers (e.g. AWS, Azure, etc)Excellent coding skills, especially in Python or R


About Our Pay & Benefits 
Airspace Link, by all definitions, is a startup. Some of you may look on our status like you would at grabbing the last Walmart shopping cart with the askew front wheel. Others will view this as a unique opportunity in a greenfield industry with huge potential upside. We hope youre the latter. 
We aim to be competitive but wont be making any headlines [yet]. We offer a full health benefit package that is tiered depending on your tenure with Airspace Link. In other words, our benefits move from good, to better, to best. 
We support a life well lived away from work. None of our benefits are about trapping people at the office or cajoling them into endless overtime. Just the opposite. Were all about reasonable working hours, ample vacation time, fitness, wellness, and healthy living. 
How To Apply 
Please send an application tailored to this position that speaks to us. Introduce yourself as a colleague. Show us the future. 
We value good communication and solid writing is part of that. We expect to see a well-constructed cover letter along with your professional history. Forget the generic resume (and it's so blatantly obvious). There's no prize for being first. Copy and paste doesn't make it very far and we strongly encourage you to take this part of the application process seriously.
In case this job gets crawled and posted somewhere unexpected, you may or may not have an ""apply now"" link, but ultimately you should end up applying here: https://airspacelink.com/geospatial-data-scientist/
