Presbyterian's story is really the story of the remarkable people who have chosen to work here. Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans. We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come. About New Mexico New Mexico's unique blend of Spanish, Mexican and Native American influences contribute to a culturally rich lifestyle. Add in Albuquerque's International Balloon Fiesta, Los Alamos' nuclear scientists, Roswell's visitors from outer space, and Santa Fe's artists, and you get an eclectic mix of people, places and experiences that make this state great. Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

Across three core Initiative focus areas of Science, Education and Justice and Opportunity, we're pairing engineering with grantmaking, impact investing, policy work, and movement building, to help build an inclusive, just and healthy future for everyone.Our ValuesWe believe we can help build a future for everyone.


We aim to be daring, but humble: We look for bold ideas — regardless of structure and stage — and help them scale by pairing engineers with subject matter experts to build tools that accelerate the pace of social progress.
We want to learn fast, but build for the long-term: We want to iterate fast and help bring new solutions to the table, but we also realize that important breakthroughs often take decades, or even centuries.
Stay close to the real problems: We engage directly in the communities we serve because no one understands our society's challenges like those who live them every day.

Our success is dependent on building teams that include people from different backgrounds and experiences who can challenge each other's assumptions with fresh perspectives. To that end, we look for a diverse pool of applicants including those from historically marginalized groups — women, people with disabilities, people of color, formerly incarcerated people, people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and/or gender nonconforming, first and second generation immigrants, veterans, and people from different socioeconomic backgrounds.The OpportunityOur mission is to support science and technology that will help make it possible to cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Do you thrive in a multi-tasking, rapid prototyping, and agile development environment? You bring the ability to draw conclusions from data and recommend actions. Good interpersonal skills are an important part of what you bring to this role.

Our minimum requirements for this role:

BS/BA in an analytical or technical field (e.g. Math, Statistics, Data Science, Computer Science, Operations Research, Physics, or Engineering). MS preferred. 5-8 years of industry experience in analytics/data science, preferably with some of that at a B2B company Consulting experience (especially analytics consulting) a plus You are skilled at defining problem statements, breaking down complex or fuzzy business problems into analytical questions, quantifying the impact to the business, synthesizing data to “tell the story,” and recommending solutions Excellent statistical understanding and experience with ML algorithms including regression, clustering, classification, decision trees, time series forecasting, neural networks, deep learning, etc. Experience with Python, R, SQL languages in analytical contexts Experience with large data sets and distributed computing, data warehousing, data integration, and ETL tools (e.g. Teradata, Hadoop, Hive, Spark, SAP HANA) Experience with ML frameworks/libraries e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, Caffe, Scikit-learn, Pandas, etc. Understanding of tools and infrastructure needed to support data science efforts.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Alto Neuroscience|"COMPANY INFORMATION - ALTO NEUROSCIENCE - altoneuroscience.com

Alto Neuroscience is a private company headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Alto is developing a new generation of neural biomarker-based diagnostic tests and personalized treatments for use in psychiatry, based on a platform built from data aggregated at scale and proprietary artificial intelligence analysis tools. The team combines world-leading neuroscientists and business executives with experience commercializing products for the brain.

There currently is no objective way to diagnose psychiatric illness, nor to identify which treatment is best for an individual patient. Treatment selection is presently done by trial-and-error as there are no reliable blood tests nor objective brain measures, for example, that can inform these decisions. This results in clinical care that is highly inefficient and costly. Alto is focused on addressing this need through finding novel brain biomarkers that can define actionable subtypes of psychiatric illnesses, or inform the development and deployment of new treatments. To that end, we are building a platform capable of identifying a pipeline of new brain-based candidate biomarkers that can underpin new product opportunities.

ROLE SUMMARY - DATA SCIENTIST

Under direct supervision of the chief technology and medical officers, the Data Scientist will complete programming tasks within a developing IT infrastructure surrounding 1) large-scale clinical and biomarker datasets and 2) incoming data from prospective clinical studies. Work will include developing data processing workflows, primarily in python, for the following tasks:

A cloud-based, real-time system for data management, quality control, pre-processing, feature extraction, and machine learning from a multimodal set of brain signalsAutomated deidentification and extraction of relevant signals from electronic medical records (EMRs)Correlating brain signals with clinical information using machine learningWork closely with Altos data science and medical teams to deliver novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for brain health

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Build and deploy machine learning models for brain signal-based prediction tasksDevelop visualization tools to interpret resultsDaily responsibilities will include algorithmic design and implementation, data analysis, coding/debugging, troubleshooting, and health monitoring/alerting

QUALIFICATIONS AND EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems Management, Engineering, or other quantitative fields2+ years of Python programming/development experience1+ years of machine learning experienceBe a team player while being able to work independentlyShare a desire to improve mental healthcare deliveryCoding experience in linux/CentOS environmentDeep understanding of predictive modeling, machine-learning, clustering and classification techniques, and algorithmsFluency in a programming language (Python, C,C++, Java, SQL)Good to have: Cloud development experience, MATLAB, and EEG data analysis experience

All that voting translates into a tremendous amount of psychographic data, revealing consumer tastes in everything from movies, to TV, to music, to sports, to brands. We want to turn all this data into something that studios, networks, and brands can use to guide their decisions, and we need your help to do it. 
The Data Scientist will play a leading role in determining how this data is leveraged and packaged. We need someone who not only has the expertise needed to navigate our data, but the vision to shape it into something truly game-changing for the entertainment industry, and eventually, for the broader market research universe. You’ll oversee the building of APIs, direct new analyses, develop user-facing products, and more. 
You don’t have to worry about a “cold start” — Ranker already has the data infrastructure and talented engineering team you need to get to work immediately. Our data is structured and ready for analysis, allowing you to start digging into consumer tastes and building sophisticated models that studios, brands, and marketers can use to inform data-driven decisions and campaigns.
We’re already expanding beyond our growing core media business and building offshoot products in both the B2B and B2C space. Much of your work will be centered around building these products, taking Ranker’s IP and building it into new tools. Our current budding projects include a TV/movie recommendation app and a B2B business around psychographic insights. 
Based in the heart of Los Angeles and established 10 years ago, the company is solidly profitable and has 80+ employees and growing.
What You’ll Do:
Drive detailed analysis to develop new insights and identify new sales, marketing, and growth opportunities
Transform complex analyses into compelling, easy-to-understand case studies and user stories
Build clear visualizations that convey complex ideas and analyses to executives and business unit leaders
Maintain and improve upon existing models and tools for internal marketing and sales teams
Translate business requirements into research components and data requirements
What You’ll Need:
Master’s degree (Ph.D. preferred) in statistics, computer science, mathematics, data science, or other quantitative science (psychology, economics, physics, etc.)
2+ years of relevant work experience in statistics, data science, or machine learning (or Ph.D. in a quantitative field)
A passion for using data to tell stories and using visualization tools to help unlock meaningful insights.
The ability to interpret and communicate complex concepts clearly to non-technical team members
Experience with quantitative analysis
A solid understanding of statistics and a demonstrated ability to understand the statistical basis of crowdsourcing
Programming and scripting skills (SQL, PHP, R, Python, etc.)
Knowledge of modern (tensorflow, keras, and pytorch) machine learning algorithms (clustering, regression, classification, optimization)
Demonstrable experience in research methodology
You Will Enjoy The Role If:
You get excited about taking ownership of problems and solving them in a fast-paced and scrappy environment, working cross-functionally with both technical and non-technical people
You want a strong data infrastructure and engineering team to back you up, rather than having to start from scratch
You are output-focused and see data science as a powerful tool to get things done, rather than as an end in itself
You are a strong critical thinker with a passion for understanding complex issues and are comfortable working on ambiguous problems
Your passion and curiosity for data is infectious"|data scientist|5|West|Los Angeles| CA

About glitchAI

AI Applications for Clear Marketing Simulation and Optimization

Understanding how marketing drives business outcomes remains one of the greatest challenges for a marketer today, despite the attention it has received over the last decade.

Historically attribution models have failed to deliver for three major reasons:


They take too long and require too many resources to build
They are too dependent on historical data and don't represent ""current"" conditions
They are not useful as tools to help manage the business

​Marketers need models that can demonstrate the impact that their efforts historically have had across the whole customer conversion path and provide an environment that allows them to test new plans with the confidence that their model represents the ""facts on the ground"".

At glitchAI we believe that modeling attribution needed to change, so we changed it.

Our models can be built in days. Our models leverage data flows that exist outside your internal resources. Our models run continuously.

As glitchAI is designed by marketing operators, the difference you will experience happens because:


glitchAI understands your business outcomes and the drivers behind them
glitchAI knows better than your competitors what is driving your category
glitchAI responds when tactics go awry (glitch) and creates advantage while your competitors are still unaware
glitchAI continuously tests in simulation the likely tactics your competition can deploy

As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

We are growing rapidly and need great people to support our analytical efforts in both Product and Marketing.

What does it take to thrive on our team? You need to be a top-notch problem solver and problem identifier as there are no points for an elegant solution to the wrong problem.

Migo|"WHAT WE DO

Imagine if every time you went to the doctor you paid cash upfront before you are treated, where every time you rented an apartment you paid 2 years cash upfront, or where your monthly paycheck is frequently delayed for months at a time. Then imagine doing that without a loan, credit card, or even bank accounts. This is everyday life for over 3 billion people in developing countries around the world. We are Migo, and we are on a mission to change this by re-inventing the way people access and use credit.

Through a simple API integration to our platform, companies can enable their customers to make purchases and pay bills on credit, or get personal loans. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on customer phone records, bank records, and payment transactions to assess credit risk, enabling us to offer credit lines to individuals and small businesses. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards. Because of our proprietary data and innovative technical solutions, Migo is able to provide credit to underbanked customers who are not typically covered by credit bureaus, a critical area of growth for developing countries.

About glitchAI

AI Applications for Clear Marketing Simulation and Optimization

Understanding how marketing drives business outcomes remains one of the greatest challenges for a marketer today, despite the attention it has received over the last decade.

Historically attribution models have failed to deliver for three major reasons:


They take too long and require too many resources to build
They are too dependent on historical data and don't represent ""current"" conditions
They are not useful as tools to help manage the business

​Marketers need models that can demonstrate the impact that their efforts historically have had across the whole customer conversion path and provide an environment that allows them to test new plans with the confidence that their model represents the ""facts on the ground"".

At glitchAI we believe that modeling attribution needed to change, so we changed it.

Our models can be built in days. Our models leverage data flows that exist outside your internal resources. Our models run continuously.

As glitchAI is designed by marketing operators, the difference you will experience happens because:


glitchAI understands your business outcomes and the drivers behind them
glitchAI knows better than your competitors what is driving your category
glitchAI responds when tactics go awry (glitch) and creates advantage while your competitors are still unaware
glitchAI continuously tests in simulation the likely tactics your competition can deploy

Earnin|"About Earnin:

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

Migo|"WHAT WE DO

Imagine if every time you went to the doctor you paid cash upfront before you are treated, where every time you rented an apartment you paid 2 years cash upfront, or where your monthly paycheck is frequently delayed for months at a time. Then imagine doing that without a loan, credit card, or even bank accounts. This is everyday life for over 3 billion people in developing countries around the world. We are Migo, and we are on a mission to change this by re-inventing the way people access and use credit.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference. Here’s how we do it.

We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (30 years strong!) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. A blockchain company. An AI/Machine Learning company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!

But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)

Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, we give our egos a break and we give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, we take bold steps, and we take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward.

Alto Neuroscience|"COMPANY INFORMATION - ALTO NEUROSCIENCE - altoneuroscience.com

Alto Neuroscience is a private company headquartered in the San Francisco Bay Area. Alto is developing a new generation of neural biomarker-based diagnostic tests and personalized treatments for use in psychiatry, based on a platform built from data aggregated at scale and proprietary artificial intelligence analysis tools. The team combines world-leading neuroscientists and business executives with experience commercializing products for the brain.

There currently is no objective way to diagnose psychiatric illness, nor to identify which treatment is best for an individual patient. Treatment selection is presently done by trial-and-error as there are no reliable blood tests nor objective brain measures, for example, that can inform these decisions. This results in clinical care that is highly inefficient and costly. Alto is focused on addressing this need through finding novel brain biomarkers that can define actionable subtypes of psychiatric illnesses, or inform the development and deployment of new treatments. To that end, we are building a platform capable of identifying a pipeline of new brain-based candidate biomarkers that can underpin new product opportunities.

ROLE SUMMARY - DATA SCIENTIST

Under direct supervision of the chief technology and medical officers, the Data Scientist will complete programming tasks within a developing IT infrastructure surrounding 1) large-scale clinical and biomarker datasets and 2) incoming data from prospective clinical studies. Work will include developing data processing workflows, primarily in python, for the following tasks:

A cloud-based, real-time system for data management, quality control, pre-processing, feature extraction, and machine learning from a multimodal set of brain signalsAutomated deidentification and extraction of relevant signals from electronic medical records (EMRs)Correlating brain signals with clinical information using machine learningWork closely with Altos data science and medical teams to deliver novel diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for brain health

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Build and deploy machine learning models for brain signal-based prediction tasksDevelop visualization tools to interpret resultsDaily responsibilities will include algorithmic design and implementation, data analysis, coding/debugging, troubleshooting, and health monitoring/alerting

QUALIFICATIONS AND EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS

Degree in Computer Science, Information Systems Management, Engineering, or other quantitative fields2+ years of Python programming/development experience1+ years of machine learning experienceBe a team player while being able to work independentlyShare a desire to improve mental healthcare deliveryCoding experience in linux/CentOS environmentDeep understanding of predictive modeling, machine-learning, clustering and classification techniques, and algorithmsFluency in a programming language (Python, C,C++, Java, SQL)Good to have: Cloud development experience, MATLAB, and EEG data analysis experience

We’re already expanding beyond our growing core media business and building offshoot products in both the B2B and B2C space. Much of your work will be centered around building these products, taking Ranker’s IP and building it into new tools.

What You’ll Do:
Drive detailed analysis to develop new insights and identify new sales, marketing, and growth opportunities
Transform complex analyses into compelling, easy-to-understand case studies and user stories
Build clear visualizations that convey complex ideas and analyses to executives and business unit leaders
Maintain and improve upon existing models and tools for internal marketing and sales teams

You Will Enjoy The Role If:
You get excited about taking ownership of problems and solving them in a fast-paced and scrappy environment, working cross-functionally with both technical and non-technical people
You want a strong data infrastructure and engineering team to back you up, rather than having to start from scratch

About glitchAI

AI Applications for Clear Marketing Simulation and Optimization

Understanding how marketing drives business outcomes remains one of the greatest challenges for a marketer today, despite the attention it has received over the last decade.

Historically attribution models have failed to deliver for three major reasons:


They take too long and require too many resources to build
They are too dependent on historical data and don't represent ""current"" conditions
They are not useful as tools to help manage the business

​Marketers need models that can demonstrate the impact that their efforts historically have had across the whole customer conversion path and provide an environment that allows them to test new plans with the confidence that their model represents the ""facts on the ground"".

At glitchAI we believe that modeling attribution needed to change, so we changed it.

Our models can be built in days. Our models leverage data flows that exist outside your internal resources. Our models run continuously.

As glitchAI is designed by marketing operators, the difference you will experience happens because:


glitchAI understands your business outcomes and the drivers behind them
glitchAI knows better than your competitors what is driving your category
glitchAI responds when tactics go awry (glitch) and creates advantage while your competitors are still unaware
glitchAI continuously tests in simulation the likely tactics your competition can deploy

Earnin|"About Earnin:

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.

About the Team:
We're looking for a talented and motivated data scientist to build sophisticated models with data collected across our business to aid Earnin's mission in giving the world access to their pay as soon as they've earned it.

As a data scientist, you'll be interfacing with analysts to gain insights, our product managers to evaluate areas where we can protect and improve our business model, and our engineering team to advance our product utilizing artificial intelligence.

Every decision made at Earnin is backed by data; our company trajectory is defined by the systems, tools, and analytics powered by our exceptional team. We integrate multifaceted data streams such as rapidly changing market data, customer data based on app activity and feedback, and financial banking operations data to perfect our processes and workflows. Improving these systems and maintaining scalability across a growing user base (X million and counting) is thrilling.

What Set Us Apart:

We care more about the thought process, perseverance, tenacity in solving really difficult problems (rather than checking off all the technology boxes)
Solving unique problems in the financial payments industry
Helping people on a human level

As a Data Scientist you will:

Build machine learning models with large-scale data across the financial markets and our internal event streams
Research and explore with various machine learning algorithms to best help on products
Work very closely with the Marketing team (User Acquisition) and shape how Marketing Science is defined and run at the company

Migo|"WHAT WE DO

Imagine if every time you went to the doctor you paid cash upfront before you are treated, where every time you rented an apartment you paid 2 years cash upfront, or where your monthly paycheck is frequently delayed for months at a time. Then imagine doing that without a loan, credit card, or even bank accounts. This is everyday life for over 3 billion people in developing countries around the world. We are Migo, and we are on a mission to change this by re-inventing the way people access and use credit.

Through a simple API integration to our platform, companies can enable their customers to make purchases and pay bills on credit, or get personal loans. Leveraging proprietary datasets, Migo builds ML algorithms on customer phone records, bank records, and payment transactions to assess credit risk, enabling us to offer credit lines to individuals and small businesses. This credit line can be used to make purchases from a merchant or withdraw cash without the need for point-of-sale hardware or plastic cards.

About glitchAI

AI Applications for Clear Marketing Simulation and Optimization

Understanding how marketing drives business outcomes remains one of the greatest challenges for a marketer today, despite the attention it has received over the last decade.

Historically attribution models have failed to deliver for three major reasons:


They take too long and require too many resources to build
They are too dependent on historical data and don't represent ""current"" conditions
They are not useful as tools to help manage the business

​Marketers need models that can demonstrate the impact that their efforts historically have had across the whole customer conversion path and provide an environment that allows them to test new plans with the confidence that their model represents the ""facts on the ground"".

At glitchAI we believe that modeling attribution needed to change, so we changed it.

Our models can be built in days. Our models leverage data flows that exist outside your internal resources. Our models run continuously.

As glitchAI is designed by marketing operators, the difference you will experience happens because:


glitchAI understands your business outcomes and the drivers behind them
glitchAI knows better than your competitors what is driving your category
glitchAI responds when tactics go awry (glitch) and creates advantage while your competitors are still unaware
glitchAI continuously tests in simulation the likely tactics your competition can deploy

Earnin|"About Earnin:

Every year, while Americans wait for their paychecks, more than $1 trillion of their hard-earned money is held up in the pay cycle. As a result, we accumulate over $50 billion in late and overdraft fees and turn to high-interest loans. Overdraft charges and bank fees often trap people in a cycle of debt that can lead to unhealthy decisions and falling victim to predatory businesses disguised as helpful services. We don't accept that.

Earnin is an app that creates products that help people gain control of their finances. Cash Out lets people get paid as soon as they leave work, with no fees, interest, or hidden costs. With Health Aid, Earnin negotiates on behalf of community members to lower their total unpaid medical bill and work out a budget-friendly payment plan. Cash Back Rewards is a way for members to earn up to 10% cash back on purchases from over a thousand local and national businesses without needing a credit card or having to reach spend thresholds to earn cash rewards — and they can withdraw the money at any time. We also offer free tools to help avoid overdrafts, to remind people when recurring bills are due, and we're working on more! There is never any required cost to use any of these products or services, users can choose to tip what they think is fair to support the service and pay it forward to keep the movement going.

Earnin is supported by funding partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Matrix Partners, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Venture, Thrive Capital, and others. Join us and help build a new financial system focused on fairness and people's needs.

You can help make a difference.
