As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

The Department of Immunology has grown to include 33 faculty, ~30 graduate students and more than 70 post-doctoral trainees. We are a strongly interactive group and share the view that the immune system provides an unparalleled platform from which to study processes common to all of mammalian biology, processes unique to host defense, and processes of clear and immediate importance to the understanding and amelioration of human disease.

The Gerner Lab in the Department of Immunology at the UW School of Medicine has an excellent opportunity for an Imaging Data Scientist (Research Scientist 4).

Research in the Gerner lab uses advanced microscopy technologies, such as multi-parameter confocal imaging and intravital 2-photon microscopy to study the development of immune responses to vaccination, infection, or during cancer. The Imaging Data Scientist will develop novel methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo cell photoconversion, or multiparameter image analysis, which will collectively allow a better understanding of how cellular positioning in tissues influences gene expression and cellular function. These new tools and findings will promote a better understanding of immune response generation in vivo, as well as advance biomedical technology development.

Responsibities:

Technology Development and Experimentation: (70%)
Independently develop or incorporate existing methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo photoconversion, and/or multiparameter image analysis.
Utilize these and other existing methods to study how cellular positioning in tissues influences gene expression and cell function. Methods may necessitate knowledge of programming (MATLAB, R), or using various imaging tools (ImageJ, Imaris). The lab uses multiplex confocal imaging and Histocytometry (10.1016/j.immuni.2012.07.011, 10.1016/j.immuni.2014.12.024, 10.1073/pnas.1708981114), as well as in vivo photoconversion (10.1126/science.aao4277) to identify localized cell events and study cellular gene expression based on tissue positioning.
In collaboration with the research team, the incumbent will link how cellular positioning in tissues and exposure to localized microenvironment influences cellular gene expression. These findings will help reveal how tissue microanatomy influences immune cell heterogeneity and the downstream immune response.

Data Analysis/Reporting, Data Presentation, and Scientific Manuscript Writing: (30%)
Incumbent will regularly present their findings in lab meetings and departmental seminars and at professional conferences.
Incumbent will be expected to published findings in peer-reviewed journals.

The Imaging Data Scientist will work highly independently with regular oversight from the PI. The individual in this position may also help train and monitor the work of junior staff using the developed tools and will interact in a collaborative manner with other teams to accomplish overarching goals. The incumbent will provide ideas to the rest of the group to improve overall efficiency.

Minimum Requirements:

Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, Biotechnology, Immunology, or related field.
At least two years of relevant experience, including experience with microscopy, bioinformatics, and analysis of gene expression. Relevant experience gained while in graduate school is acceptable.

Desired:

Programming skills, in vivo immunological assays, experience in image analysis.

As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

The Department of Immunology has grown to include 33 faculty, ~30 graduate students and more than 70 post-doctoral trainees. We are a strongly interactive group and share the view that the immune system provides an unparalleled platform from which to study processes common to all of mammalian biology, processes unique to host defense, and processes of clear and immediate importance to the understanding and amelioration of human disease.

The Gerner Lab in the Department of Immunology at the UW School of Medicine has an excellent opportunity for an Imaging Data Scientist (Research Scientist 4).

Research in the Gerner lab uses advanced microscopy technologies, such as multi-parameter confocal imaging and intravital 2-photon microscopy to study the development of immune responses to vaccination, infection, or during cancer. The Imaging Data Scientist will develop novel methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo cell photoconversion, or multiparameter image analysis, which will collectively allow a better understanding of how cellular positioning in tissues influences gene expression and cellular function. These new tools and findings will promote a better understanding of immune response generation in vivo, as well as advance biomedical technology development.

Responsibities:

Technology Development and Experimentation: (70%)
Independently develop or incorporate existing methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo photoconversion, and/or multiparameter image analysis.

In collaboration with the research team, the incumbent will link how cellular positioning in tissues and exposure to localized microenvironment influences cellular gene expression. These findings will help reveal how tissue microanatomy influences immune cell heterogeneity and the downstream immune response.

Data Analysis/Reporting, Data Presentation, and Scientific Manuscript Writing: (30%)
Incumbent will regularly present their findings in lab meetings and departmental seminars and at professional conferences.
Incumbent will be expected to published findings in peer-reviewed journals.

The Imaging Data Scientist will work highly independently with regular oversight from the PI.

As a UW employee, you will enjoy generous benefits and work/life programs. For a complete description of our benefits for this position, please visit our website, click here.

Please note that this position has been reposted. If you have already submitted your application, you need not submit it again, as it has already been received.



As a UW employee, you have a unique opportunity to change lives on our campuses, in our state and around the world. UW employees offer their boundless energy, creative problem solving skills and dedication to build stronger minds and a healthier world.

UW faculty and staff also enjoy outstanding benefits, professional growth opportunities and unique resources in an environment noted for diversity, intellectual excitement, artistic pursuits and natural beauty. All of which has allowed the UW to be nationally recognized as a “Great College to Work For” for four consecutive years.

The Department of Immunology has grown to include 33 faculty, ~30 graduate students and more than 70 post-doctoral trainees. We are a strongly interactive group and share the view that the immune system provides an unparalleled platform from which to study processes common to all of mammalian biology, processes unique to host defense, and processes of clear and immediate importance to the understanding and amelioration of human disease.

The Gerner Lab in the Department of Immunology at the UW School of Medicine has an excellent opportunity for an Imaging Data Scientist (Research Scientist 4).

Research in the Gerner lab uses advanced microscopy technologies, such as multi-parameter confocal imaging and intravital 2-photon microscopy to study the development of immune responses to vaccination, infection, or during cancer. The Imaging Data Scientist will develop novel methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo cell photoconversion, or multiparameter image analysis, which will collectively allow a better understanding of how cellular positioning in tissues influences gene expression and cellular function. These new tools and findings will promote a better understanding of immune response generation in vivo, as well as advance biomedical technology development.

Responsibities:

Technology Development and Experimentation: (70%)
Independently develop or incorporate existing methods for in situ analysis of gene expression, in vivo photoconversion, and/or multiparameter image analysis.
Utilize these and other existing methods to study how cellular positioning in tissues influences gene expression and cell function. Methods may necessitate knowledge of programming (MATLAB, R), or using various imaging tools (ImageJ, Imaris). The lab uses multiplex confocal imaging and Histocytometry (10.1016/j.immuni.2012.07.011, 10.1016/j.immuni.2014.12.024, 10.1073/pnas.1708981114), as well as in vivo photoconversion (10.1126/science.aao4277) to identify localized cell events and study cellular gene expression based on tissue positioning.
In collaboration with the research team, the incumbent will link how cellular positioning in tissues and exposure to localized microenvironment influences cellular gene expression. These findings will help reveal how tissue microanatomy influences immune cell heterogeneity and the downstream immune response.

Data Analysis/Reporting, Data Presentation, and Scientific Manuscript Writing: (30%)
Incumbent will regularly present their findings in lab meetings and departmental seminars and at professional conferences.
Incumbent will be expected to published findings in peer-reviewed journals.

The Imaging Data Scientist will work highly independently with regular oversight from the PI. The individual in this position may also help train and monitor the work of junior staff using the developed tools and will interact in a collaborative manner with other teams to accomplish overarching goals. The incumbent will provide ideas to the rest of the group to improve overall efficiency.

Minimum Requirements:

Ph.D. in Bioinformatics, Biotechnology, Immunology, or related field.
At least two years of relevant experience, including experience with microscopy, bioinformatics, and analysis of gene expression. Relevant experience gained while in graduate school is acceptable.

Desired:

Programming skills, in vivo immunological assays, experience in image analysis.
  Committed to attracting and retaining a diverse staff, the University of Washington will honor your experiences, perspectives and unique identity. Together, our community strives to create and maintain working and learning environments that are inclusive, equitable and welcoming.

Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research,"OverviewCures Start Here. At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch’s pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation’s first cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women’s Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Careers Start Here.

The Innovation Laboratory (iLab) at Fred Hutch is seeking a Masters- or PhD-level data scientist. The iLab is a new collaborative initiative of the Immunotherapy and Translational Data Science Integrated Research Centers (IIRC and TDS_IRC) with a mission to advance the introduction and development of new immuno-oncology research technologies. The iLab will spur in-house development and early adoption of novel techniques, including advanced single cell RNA spatial sequencing, T- and B-cell receptor sequencing, and other DNA/RNA-based technologies. The data scientist will work closely with lab personnel and immunotherapy researchers to develop data analysis methods for new technologies.

Over the past three years, Fred Hutch has launched three Integrated Research Centers (IRCs) to increase collaborative research across the Center and stimulate transformative cancer discovery. The IIRC, led by Dr. Stanley Riddell, and the TDS_IRC, led by Dr. Raphael Gottardo, have joined together and created the iLab to speed adoption of novel technologies, particularly those that generate large datasets of high utility to immunotherapy. The successful candidate will be embedded in the iLab, but will also have close ties to the Gottardo Lab and the TDS_IRC. The iLab will initially be housed in the Bielas Lab. Working closely with Drs. Bielas and Gottardo, the successful candidate will function with a high degree of independence as they manage daily activities. We see the integration of computational work within the iLab as an integral part of its success, providing computational innovation.

The mission of the Systems Intelligence team is to provide situational awareness to Amazon’s leaders enabling them to make decisions that will directly impact the culture of software development. A Sr. Data Scientist is critical to the success of this program to analyze the data we collect and provide statistical correlations that will drive future business decisions. Our team must provide visibility into the metadata collected from Amazon’s internal systems, software development tools, developer output metrics, and internal surveys to highlight differences across organizations. These variances will help drive discussions and investigations into areas that present potential bottlenecks or risks to software delivery. Based on the learnings from these investigations, we will identify best practices that can be shared with all levels of the organization to drive continuous improvement. A Sr. Data Scientist will complete the feedback cycle for our team, synthesizing the data we collect, providing correlation analysis, and guiding future investigations.

As a Data Scientist, your role will be to leverage the past data to make future predictions, thereby helping us mitigate the uncertainty of the future by making predictions of future performance. While business intelligence tends to be structured, data science leans more toward the unstructured. You must deal with incomplete, messy, unorganized data, not immediately usable without some degree of cleaning and prepping. You will generate predictive insights and new product innovations by applying advanced analytical tools and algorithms utilizing advanced statistical packages, SQL, Hadoop, and open source tools like Python and Perl.

In 2019, our team will deliver a dashboard for software development managers that provides in depth insights and business metrics about their teams, providing historical trending analysis along with comparisons against organizational averages, guiding managers toward improvement opportunities in development agility. By gathering datasets such as deployments, code submissions, code reviews, and team hierarchy, the dashboard will also provide a view for technical leaders to drive crosscutting initiatives such as SDE Ratios, remote code contributions, and migration to native AWS. Success will be measured by providing a dashboard built on Systems Intelligence (our internal data lake) that improves development agility. Examples include quantifying the efficiency gained by migrating to optimized platforms (pre-compute queries and deployment automation) along with identifying teams that could benefit from leveraging these services. Other examples include enabling teams to track increases in deployment velocity, increase in code coverage, and/or reduction in technical debt. With the cost of engineering resources constantly on the rise, leaders must seek opportunities to increase the efficiency of software development. Attempting to quantify software agility and baseline the maturity of software development teams has been a long-standing challenge because of the complexity in the development process and various forms of output. Providing visibility into the outcome of software development enables teams to identify maturity opportunities within their own processes and better understand the impact of changes.

employHER,"We are looking for a Data Engineer (BIE) with strong analytical, communication and project management skills to join our team. Working closely with business stakeholders and senior leadership, you will help identify and solve complex language and currency problems and develop metrics and reports to measure our impact on our business. In a typical day, you will work closely with the product management team, retail teams, machine-learning scientists, statisticians, software engineers, and various business groups.

About you:

You're looking for a career where you'll be able to build, to deliver, and to impress. You look at problems holistically and thrive on the intricate complexity of designing feedback loops and ecosystems. You want to work on projects where you are implementing solutions to real problems that require creative solutions and deep understanding of the problem space.

You challenge yourself and others to constantly come up with better solutions. This highly visible role requires frequent communication with senior leadership in order to help shape and deliver on the product roadmap and requires you to nimbly switch between strategic and tactical initiatives to achieve technical, business, and customer experience goals. You'll be given the unique opportunity to own and drive initiatives across the Our Retail as a whole - from algorithmic innovation, all the way down to the datasets that the back-end services consume.

About us together:

We're going to change the way that Our thinks about supporting our global customer. Along the way, we're going to face seemingly impossible problems. We're going to argue about how to solve them, and we'll work together to find a solution that is superior to each of the proposals we came in with. We'll make tough decisions, but we'll all understand why. We'll be the dream team.

The ideal candidate for this space will be highly quantitative, have great judgment, strong data mining and modeling skills and is comfortable facilitating ideation and working from concept through to execution. You will have demonstrated an ability to manage and develop medium to large-scale data tables, identify requirements and build financial reporting and planning models and tools that are statistically grounded but also explainable operationally, apply technical skills allowing the models to adapt to changing attributes, optimize forecast accuracy and to better understand and mitigate model variance drivers. In addition to building data tables, modeling and technical skills, you will possess strong written and verbal communication skills, strong focus on internal customers and professional demeanor and high intellectual curiosity with ability to learn new concepts and frameworks, algorithms and technology rapidly as changes arise.

Some problem spaces we'll be working on:

DATAMART - as we release new languages across marketplaces, our business teams will want to understand customer trends and interactions with these new marketplaces. Ideally, we want to enable our business teams to report on the various languages within a marketplace as if those languages were individual businesses. As such, we need to create a DataMart that enables all business metrics to be split by language and also enables business users to execute ad hoc queries to answer questions that we have not currently considered. As we create the DataMart, we will have to consider the scale of data that we will be handling (at the scale of our global retail business) and employ Bigdata techniques to aggregate and manipulate this data. We will need to design the platform to be robust and to seamlessly recover from disaster, should the need arise. Consistency and validation will be primary concerns as we understand that systems fail, specifically systems upon which we rely for signal and we need to protect our business teams from making decisions based upon incomplete information.

CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE - as arbiters of the customer experience, we need to understand our customers' experience in their languages of preference. Similarly, given the scope of this initiative, it is clear that we will not be able to translate all content in a single release. As a result, it is critical that we can truly measure the customer experience as a function of our translations (both coverage and quality) throughout their journey within the Our marketplace. This is further complicated by the fact that our customers receive a unique experience based upon their browse history, so our method of measurement must be considerate of and support such a dynamic experience. Furthermore, in real time and with zero latency, we want to understand when the experience is broken so that we can take appropriate actions. This is going to be a challenge that may make use of the latest Bigdata streaming technologies to provide a real-time data and measurement pipeline.

Questions?

You may already know if you're a fit, but perhaps you're worried about technology and experience requirements? Don't be - we're looking for smart, proven, engineers; if you're the right candidate, we're flexible.
