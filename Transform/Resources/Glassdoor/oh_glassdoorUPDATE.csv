What Will You Be Doing?

We utilize a multidisciplinary approach in our research that encompasses genomic medicine, neuroscience, stem cell biology, biochemistry and molecular genetics to investigate the dynamic nature of the developing mammalian brain both in the context of disease and injury and under normal physiology. There have been major advances in identifying the genetic basis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism and pediatric epilepsy. However, a critical knowledge gap still remains, how do genetic mutations contribute to the molecular mechanisms involved in these complex disorders?

To address this knowledge gap, our team is leveraging several key technological tools that include the use of: human brain organoid models, genome editing tools, OMICs technologies, and the use of novel transgenic mouse models to move the field forward in autism and pediatric epilepsy research. We are using these innovative tools as a platform to test our hypotheses for understanding how gene mutations contribute to the molecular mechanisms that drive the pathogenesis of these neurological disorders.

The long-term goal of our research program is to identify molecular mechanisms of neurodevelopmental disorders that will allow us to develop targeted therapies to improve health outcomes and quality of life for pediatric patients. A central area of research emphasis is to develop advanced high content imaging platforms to analyze complex deep phenotypes in diseased human cerebral organoids for screening and identification of potential therapeutic candidates.

The research will be performed in collaboration with the Materials and Manufacturing Directorate of the Air Force Research Laboratory at Wright Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, OH.

Recent reports on autonomous materials and mechanically bi-stable structures have demonstrated that environmentally-responsive architectures can be designed using truth tables, such that logic functions and mechanical response are inherently coupled. Three key innovations are necessary to forward these concepts. First, mechanically bi-stable and multi-stable units that enable universal logic, such as a stimuli responsive Adder, needs to be discovered. Second, design tools must be developed that enable optimization of material properties and network architecture to maximize re-programmability and other application-specific responses. Finally, modeling and simulation techniques are required to predict properties (structural efficiency, computation speed, environmental responsivity, etc.) of the overall structure for integration into a soft robotic design.

Excellent oral and written communication skills are a prerequisite for employment. The successful candidate will be self-motivated and capable of working independently, as well as an effective collaborator with researchers from different technical backgrounds.

Requirements

A PhD in Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Applied Math, Electrical Engineering, Materials Science, or related field of study is required
Technical computing experience in computational mechanics
Experience with optimization, classification, and machine learning methods
This position is working within a government facility and requires U.S. Citizenship

AN EXPLANATION OF PROJECT STAFFING:

STAFFING: A ""project basis staffing"" is a job temporarily assigned in order to perform a specific activity in support of an approved corporate project. The assignment is typically two years or less. The limited life of this assignment distinguishes a ""project"" position from most other positions. Project staffing allows management a greater level of flexibility in selecting an incumbent with the needed level of expertise. Because of the truly temporary status of the project job, the need for specific skills, and a fair administration of compensation for project personnel, the project jobs are to be staffed on a lateral basis (i.e. the incumbent remains on the same pay band he/she held before project participation).

LENGTH OF ASSIGNMENT: The assignment is typically two years or less. However there are two types of project staffing assignments. A short-term assignment would normally be four months or less and would not involve a permanent transfer. Salary would be administered as normal, and the previous position would typically be held open. A long term project assignment would be longer than four months, could involve relocation, and the employee's previous position would be re-staffed or eliminated. Qualified associates will typically be provided 60 calendar days to search for a new position. For clarification, contact your local HR representative.

SALARY ADMINISTRATION: Individuals hired would typically receive a pro-rated merit increase. During the project, merit salary adjustments pursuant to the salary administration guidelines will be based on the employee's pay band at the time of placement on the project job. Performance evaluations will be conducted as they would on any job as appropriate.

END OF PROJECT: Prior to the end of the project, Human Resources will be notified by the Project Executive regarding the project completion date. Human Resources will assist the project job holder for a period of sixty calendar days, if qualified, in his/her search for a position . The success of the associate in securing a position is contingent upon prior related work experience, satisfactory performance on the project and the availability of open positions matching the associates? skills and experience. The associate is expected to compete for positions with other Nationwide associates and/or external applicants. There is no guarantee that the associate leaving the project will secure another position.

JOB CONDITIONS:

Overtime Eligibility: Not Eligible (Exempt).

Working Conditions: Normal office environment.

ADA: The above statements cover what are generally believed to be principal and essential functions of this job. Specific circumstances may allow or require some people assigned to the job to perform a somewhat different combination of duties.

Credit Check: AS APPLICABLE TO THE SPECIFIC PROJECT - Due to the fiduciary accountabilities within this job, a valid credit check and/or background check will be required as part of the selection process.

Nationwide Children's Hospital. A Place to Be Proud.

What Will You Be Doing?

Our passion and vision is to rapidly translate research discoveries into lasting treatment options for pediatric patients afflicted with Central Nervous System (CNS) tumors. Specifically, our laboratory is studying the mechanisms that potentiate low to high grade glioma progression. We use transgenic brain tumor mouse models that recapitulate low to high grade glioma progression and correlate our findings with peripheral blood and tumor specimens from patients with CNS tumors. These models also serve as a platform to explore the contribution of the tumor microenvironment and myeloid cells in low grade glioma progression and also test novel therapeutic agents aimed at impairing malignant transformation. Furthermore, modulating myeloid-derived cell population recruitment using JAK 1/2 Inhibitors prior to malignant tumor progression has shown translational promise.

While advances have demonstrated the importance of the microenvironment in various solid tumors, a critical knowledge gap exists with regards to understanding how myeloid cell heterogeneity and cross-talk with other immune cells plays a role in enhancing low grade glioma progression. To address this critical knowledge gap, our team is using a multi-disciplinary approach that leverages single cell sequencing and NGS along with cancer and molecular biology techniques to investigate the dynamic nature of the evolving immune microenvironment within gliomas.

Our long-term goals are to use these innovative tools in order to translate our findings into new age clinical trials for patients with gliomas and validate select myeloid cell populations as in-vivo biomarkers that may enhance risk stratification and targeted approaches for this patient population.

Ultimately, the passion and vision of the Rajappa Lab is to rapidly translate research discoveries into lasting treatment options for pediatric patients afflicted with CNS tumors. If you share this passion and vision, please send your CV, a cover letter, names of 3 references with contact information, and a one page statement of your research interests to Prajwal.Rajappa@nationwidechildrens.org

Please include ""Translational Neuro-Oncology Postdoc Position"" in the subject line. Competitive applications will be evaluated when they are received and the position will remain open until the position is filled.
