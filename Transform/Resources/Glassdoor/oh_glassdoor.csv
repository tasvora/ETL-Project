Earnin|"About Earnin:
Our financial system is fundamentally unfair for people who live paycheck to paycheck. People shouldn't have to wait weeks to get the pay they've already earned. This wait forces them to spend more than $100 billion a year on short-term credit products, late fees and overdraft fees.

Earnin helps people overcome this unfairness by giving them real-time access to their money as soon as they have worked -- without fees or interest.

Our team is bound together by a desire to level the financial playing field. Our investors, Andreessen Horowitz, Ribbit Capital, Felicis Ventures, Matrix Partners and March Capital believe we will change the world.

You can help make a difference. Join us.

About the Team:
We're looking for a talented and motivated data scientist to build sophisticated models with data collected across our business to aid Earnin's mission in giving the world access to their pay as soon as they've earned it.

Data Scientists are the central node to every team within Earnin. As a data scientist, you'll be interfacing with analysts to gain insights, our product managers to evaluate areas where we can protect and improve our business model, and our engineering team to advance our product utilizing artificial intelligence.

Every decision made at Earnin is backed by data; our company trajectory is defined by the systems, tools, and analytics powered by our exceptional team. We integrate multifaceted data streams such as rapidly changing market data, customer data based on app activity and feedback, and financial banking operations data to perfect our processes and workflows. Improving these systems and maintaining scalability across a growing user base (X million and counting) is thrilling, particularly on a team of 4.

Research and prototype solutions based on various machine learning algorithms to help design and deploy the best possible products
Optimize models by adding more features, improving algorithms, tuning parameters
Continuously monitor and improve model performance
Work closely with product, analytics, and engineering teams - make your models scalable, explainable, and actionable

Some skills we consider critical to being a Data Scientist:

Solid understanding of machine learning and statistics
Strong business and product sense, analytical thinking
Experience building predictive models across the full development cycle, from data collection and exploratory analysis to scalable production
Experience building complex SQL queries
Proficient in any of the following: Python, R, Spark, Scala
3+ years industry experience in data mining, machine learning, statistical analysis, and modeling
Excellent communication skills
